# Disekt

A disk-sector visualisation tool
Takes a C64 image file and displays the BAM (Block-Availability Map)
in a circular disk.

It also works for checking the integrity of a disk backed up using my
janky custom tool. This means it can show the quality of a sector's
information based on whether or not the checksums match and if
a certain sector is missing or not.
